DP Patterns :

1. Partition DP :
   - The moment you see keyword like partition its partition dp.
   - Here we have index which is usually start and the lb  and then a for loop which provides us with a range of partitions between index and i.


2. MCM :
   - Here out objectives is to break problems at different places by applying k cuts.
   - Applying cuts is the key which ranges between i and j.



3. LIS :
   - Every element is a LIS in itself. (Golden Rule) 
   - Here we have a single index and a variable which keeps track of the previous index.
   - We have 2 choices either to take or not to take the current index based on certain conditions.


4. Strings :
   - This is mostly around LCS based questions with quiet similar approach of i-1, j-1


5. Subsets :
	- This follows the take or not take approach.
	- Most of the times we have a target achieve. In case we dont have a target explicitly given then we need to dig in the statement to find it.It will definitely be there.


6. 2D :
	- We deal with matrix based problems.
	- Mostly down and right directions


7. 1D :
	- 1 jump or 2 jump
