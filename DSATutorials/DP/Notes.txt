/*
  1. Both Dungeon game and Cherry pick are very unique problems, make sure to always keep revise.
  2. Not all problems require +1 in dp.
  3. Remember that in DP problems always make sure to double check on boundary conditions
  4. The key to write correct tabulation resides in how good the Recurrence has been written
  5. In DP grid the dp array is from 0 to n-1 like dp[n,m]. However for Subsets it from dp[n+1, m+1] to adjust the targets also sometime doing co-ordinate shifting
  6. IN problems like cherrypick for memo we use -1 to say the path is not computed but in tabu we use min.value saying initially all paths are invalid


  DP Patterns :

  1D Array : one jump or 2 jump

  2D Array : right, down or up , left

  Subsets : Take  and not take  + (+1 in dp for target)

  MCM : general formula :
      arr[i-1] * arr[k] * arr[j]
  

  Recursion funda : Pick a value , keep digging deep till you hit base case and return the value, then try with new value and repeat the process.
  try best value from all above values obtained
