Recursion:

1) There are 2 kinds of patterns we have seen so far :
   a) Permutations
   b) Subsets


2) For permutation we usually have a for loop

3) For subsets we usually have 2 choices at each step (include or exclude)

4) For permutation based problem if duplicates are given in array , use set to exclude duplicates at same level.

5) For subsets based problem if duplicates are given in array, first sort the array and then use a while loop to move out

6) In combination sum problem we will also go till target == 0. Unlike susbet problem where we also go till index == 0. As this makes sure that anytome we get a target we count as success,
rather in Subset problem we will travserse till entire list till index ==0 in a hope
