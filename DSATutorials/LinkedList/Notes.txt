/*1) Singly and circular linked list reversal is straight with prev, curr and next nodes only.

2) For doubly and circular doubly linked list reversal, we need to swap the prev and next pointers of each node. Use Swap method to swap
the prev and next pointers of each node.

3) Always remember to see if two pointers fast or slow are needed or not.

4) 3 variations of fast pointers :

    a) slow = null, fast = head;
    b) slow = head, fast = head;
    c) slow = head, fast = head.next;

5) Most problems can be solved using fast and slow pointers.

6) When we use fast and slow to find the mid , the len of first part will always be bigger than second part*/
